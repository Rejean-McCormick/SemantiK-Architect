# SemantiK Architect 1.3.0-alpha.1 — MathKristal / Informath integration

SemantiK Architect is a deterministic semantic-to-human multilingual communication engine. The 1.3 alpha keeps the Kristal v6 articulation boundary and adds the first **mathematical communication profile**: MathKristal Formula IR is projected explicitly into the canonical semantic graph, planned as a mathematical articulation operation, and delegated to **Informath / MathCore / GF** for verbal realization.

## What 1.3 adds

- `MathKristalFormulaAcl` for `mathkristal.formula-ir` 1.0.0;
- full structural traceability from Formula IR nodes into the canonical semantic graph;
- `math-pure-1` and `math-natural-1` planning paths;
- `math.informalize_formula` as an additive realization operation;
- `InformathMathRealizer`, invoked through the existing `RealizerPort`;
- Formula IR → Dedukti projection and versioned Informath symbol registries;
- a candidate Euler profile and schemas/examples;
- Python SDK and CLI surfaces: `project-math` and `render-math`;
- no embedded French/English mathematical grammar and no hidden template fallback.

The profile remains **candidate-only** until a concrete Informath runtime is pinned, hashed, and passes language/profile conformance.

## Canonical pipeline

```text
external domain model / Kristal v6 / MathKristal Formula IR
        ↓ explicit ACL / communication projection
CommunicationRequest
        ↓
CommunicationPlanner
        ↓
CommunicationPlan
        ↓ lexical preflight
LanguagePlanner
        ↓
LanguagePlan / RealizationUnit
        ↓ exact lexical binding when required
RealizerPort
        ├─ generic language → versioned SA↔GF bridge → PGF/GF
        └─ mathematical language → Informath → MathCore/Informath → GF/RGL
        ↓
CommunicationResult + coverage + RuntimeSet identity
```

There is still one application pipeline. Only the realization adapter is specialized by an explicit operation/profile; no semantic or grammatical fallback is inferred at runtime.

## MathKristal integration

SemantiK Architect does not parse LaTeX to guess mathematics. It consumes a structure-first Formula IR through:

```text
semantik.mathkristal-formula-ir.communication-projection/1.0
```

The caller explicitly supplies the Formula IR and selects the expression/proposition to articulate. The ACL maps every relevant formula node to canonical graph nodes/statements, adds one explicit `present-formula` articulation anchor, and stores the original Formula IR as supporting context for the specialized realizer.

Example:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src:. python -m semantik_architect.adapters.inbound.cli.main \
  --runtime-root runtime \
  project-math examples/mathkristal_euler_formula.json \
  --language fr --mode PURE
```

`PURE` targets the unique/verbose MathCore-style realization. `NATURAL` allows an admitted Informath runtime to request controlled variations. SemantiK never upgrades either rendering to mathematical truth.

- [`docs/reference/INFORMATH_MATH_REALIZATION.md`](docs/reference/INFORMATH_MATH_REALIZATION.md)
- [`profiles/math-pure-1/`](profiles/math-pure-1/)

## Kristal v6 integration

`KristalV6Acl` remains unchanged in authority: raw `kristal_state` is never interpreted as a communication request. Upstream selection is explicit, all selected assertions remain traceable through `source_refs`, and valuations/actionability stay supporting context rather than becoming communication obligations.

MathKristal Formula IR can also be wrapped in the existing Kristal v6 communication projection when the corresponding proposition/assertion is present in an authoritative v6 state.

## Lexical and grammar authorities

The established authority split remains:

```text
Wikidata / Wikidata Lexeme → generic lexical knowledge
Domain/project terminology → explicit overrides
Informath symbol registry → formal-math ↔ GF concept bindings
GF/RGL → morphology, syntax, word order, agreement, final realization
SemantiK Architect → communication planning and articulation only
```

## Validation

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src:. python tools/validate_repository.py
```

Current snapshot validation: **58 tests pass; 16 JSON Schemas validate**.

## Fail-closed invariant

Missing Formula IR structure, unmapped math symbols, unavailable Informath, unsupported language, invalid RuntimeSet identity, lexical gaps, or GF/Informath failures are explicit errors. SemantiK Architect does not silently substitute prose templates or change mathematical meaning.
